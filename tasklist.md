## To Do
- [ ] Enable multi site queries
    - [ ] Using bounding box or shapefiles
    - [ ] Process the response into individual results (xml parsing needs to identify the individual site results for the multi site response)
- [ ] Enable more complex time filters (current is between dates)
    - [ ] Enable after a date
    - [ ] Enable outside of a period
- [ ] Plot point results on map
- [ ] Enable pop up on map point to display site info 
- [ ] Extract observation offerings 'Procedure Identifiers' (eg Pat1_C_B_1_DailyMean or Pat9_C_B_1_DailyMean) and observed properties 'Parameters' (eg Water Coarse Level) into lists from 'GetCapabilities'
    - [ ] Build and populate widgets to allow easy selection of these variables
- [ ] Further xml parsing from responses;
    - [ ] timeseries
    - [ ] feature properties
        - Name
        - id
        - location
        - available properties (Procedures, Parameters)
- [ ] Develop a demo using Loci
- [ ] Maintain environment and env setup
- [ ] Create a python package for core logic
- [ ] Develop a workflow using core package demonstrating functionality
- [ ] Enable GetDataAvailability to use SOS. Currently implemented using KVP method
